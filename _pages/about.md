I am a Master's student in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas, where I've worked with Prof. [Vincent Ng](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~vince/){:target="_blank"} on optimizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models and Prof. [Yapeng Tian](https://www.yapengtian.com/index.html){:target="_blank"} on computer vision problems. Previously, I completed my B.Tech at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).

Broadly, I'm interested in making <b>efficient and capable AI</b> systems, with a focus on LLMs and multimodal learning. My current research spans optimization of RAG systems, where I've developed novel frameworks for joint optimization of retrievers and LLMs. Previously, I've worked on developing model architectures for combining visual and audio modalities for better performance on downstream tasks. I've also developed methods for personalized image editing using diffusion models.

I enjoy tackling challenging technical problems - from designing data processing pipelines and implementing complex model architectures to developing optimization frameworks.

# üìã Experience 

- **üî¨ Optimizing RAG Models**: Developed an end-to-end fine-tuning framework enabling joint optimization of retriever and generator components in RAG settings. Created information-theoretic scoring mechanisms for strategic document selection, achieving 30% performance improvement per memory unit. Open-sourced as [ContextFlow](https://github.com/shubhampatel77/contextflow){:target="_blank"}  with comprehensive documentation and HuggingFace integration.

- **üéØ Computer Vision**: Designed a novel cross-attention mechanism aligning temporal audio features with spatial embeddings for active speaker detection. Built an automated annotation pipeline for face tracking and developed efficient Python tools for speaker activity labeling. System demonstrates robust performance in noisy environments with multiple speakers.

- **üñºÔ∏è Diffusion models**: Implemented a two-stage fine-tuning approach for diffusion models enabling single-image personalization through careful regularization and token binding. Developed custom loss functions and training strategies to maintain model generalization while achieving high-fidelity instance integration. Feel free to check out my [blog post](/posts/2024/07/blog-post-1/).

- **‚öôÔ∏è ML Systems**: Built distributed training infrastructure using Ray/MLflow and implemented CI/CD pipelines with Docker/Kubernetes achieving 95% uptime. Developed hybrid BM25/dense retrieval system with custom dataloaders preserving document boundaries, resulting in 40% faster retrieval while maintaining context quality.
