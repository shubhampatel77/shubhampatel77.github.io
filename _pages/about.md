I am a Master's student in Computer Science at The University of Texas at Dallas, where I've worked with Prof. [Vincent Ng](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~vince/){:target="_blank"} on optimizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) models and Prof. [Yapeng Tian](https://www.yapengtian.com/index.html){:target="_blank"} on computer vision problems. Previously, I completed my B.Tech at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IITM).

Broadly, I'm interested in making <b>efficient and capable AI</b> systems, with a focus on LLMs and multimodal learning. My current research spans optimization of RAG systems, where I've developed novel frameworks for joint optimization of retrievers and LLMs. Previously, I've worked on developing model architectures for combining visual and audio modalities for better performance on downstream tasks. I've also developed methods for personalized image editing using diffusion models.

I enjoy tackling challenging technical problems - from designing data processing pipelines and implementing complex model architectures to developing optimization frameworks.

<b>I am on the academic job market for 2025! Feel free to reach out to me if you find my work relevant!</b>

# üìã Experience 

- **RAG Framework Engineering**: Designed and implemented an end-to-end optimization framework for LLMs that overcomes prompt augmentation non-differentiability, enabling gradient flow to retrievers in RAG systems. Developed custom information-theoretic document selection algorithms that achieved 30% accuracy improvement per memory unit.

- **ML Infrastructure Optimization**: Engineered comprehensive memory optimization techniques including mixed precision training, 8-bit quantization, 8-bit optimizers and gradient checkpointing, resulting in 70% memory reduction while maintaining model performance for Llama-3-8B deployments.

- **Multimodal Architecture Development**: Created a transformer-based system for active speaker detection that successfully aligns temporal audio features with visual embeddings through innovative cross-attention mechanisms. Built complete pipeline from data processing to evaluation logic.

- **Annotation & Data Pipeline Engineering**: Developed an automated annotation system with multi-face detection and tracking algorithms plus an efficient UI design, reducing labeling time by 75% while maintaining annotation quality for multimodal training.

- **Fine-tuning System Design**: Implemented a novel two-stage approach for diffusion models enabling personalized image editing with high semantic compatibility (CLIP-T score of 29) and strong perceptual similarity (LPIPS of 0.2) between source images and generated outputs. Feel free to check out my [blog post](/posts/2024/07/blog-post-1/).

# Projects

- **High-Performance Computing Platform**: Engineered a Linux-based distributed training infrastructure using Kubernetes for container orchestration and dynamic resource allocation. Implemented custom monitoring dashboards and automated scaling policies for multi-GPU RLHF workloads, achieving 23% reduction in harmful outputs while maintaining 99.5% uptime.

- **Service Reliability Engineering**: Developed containerized microservices on AWS ECS with Docker-based CI/CD pipelines and Linux performance tuning. Designed fault-tolerant architecture with ELK monitoring, TCP connection pooling, and MySQL sharding strategies that reduced deployment time by 37% and service latency by 28%.
